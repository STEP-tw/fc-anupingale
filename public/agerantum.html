					Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical
					and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
					Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
					America and Mexico but four are native to the United States.
				</p>

				<p>
					They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The
					opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins
					are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.
				</p>

					The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and
					spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
